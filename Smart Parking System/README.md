# Project: Smart Parking System

This project demonstrates a basic **automated parking system** using Arduino. It detects the availability of parking slots using IR sensors and operates entry and exit barriers with servo motors. Real-time slot status is displayed on a 16x2 LCD, making it a helpful tool for parking management systems.

## ðŸ“Ÿ Code Explanation:

- **Initialization (`setup()`)**:
  - LCD is initialized and displays a welcome message.
  - Servo motors are attached and set to initial position (0Â°).
  - IR sensors are configured as inputs.

- **Main Loop (`loop()`)**:
  - Continuously checks if parking slots are occupied using IR sensors.
  - Updates the LCD with slot availability status.
  - If a car is detected at the entry sensor, the **entry gate servo rotates** to allow entry.
  - If a car is detected at the exit sensor, the **exit gate servo rotates** to open the exit.
  - Servos return to the closed (0Â°) position if no car is detected.
