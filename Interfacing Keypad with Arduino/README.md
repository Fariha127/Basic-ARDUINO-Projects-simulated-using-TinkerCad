# Interfacing Keypad with Arduino

## Project Overview:
This project demonstrates how to interface a 4x4 keypad with an Arduino to detect and display key presses on the Serial Monitor. The keypad is used to capture user input by pressing various keys, and the Arduino processes the input to display the key pressed.

## Components Used:
- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Uno, Mega, Nano)
- **4x4 Keypad**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard** (optional)

## Circuit Connections:
### Keypad Pins:
- Connect the rows of the keypad to the Arduino pins: 9, 8, 7, 6.
- Connect the columns of the keypad to the Arduino pins: 5, 4, 3, 2.
- Ensure the correct connections for the keypad's row and column pins as per the wiring diagram.

## Code Explanation:
### Keypad Initialization:
- The **Keypad** library is used to facilitate interaction with the 4x4 keypad.
- The **keys** array maps the key characters, where each row and column represents a specific button.
- The **rowPins** and **colPins** arrays map the physical connections between the keypad and the Arduino.

### Keypad Input Handling (`loop()`):
- In the loop, the program continuously checks for a key press using `keypad.getKey()`.
- When a key is pressed, the character is read and displayed in the Serial Monitor using `Serial.print()` and `Serial.println()`.

### Serial Monitor Output:
- When a key is pressed, the key value is sent to the Serial Monitor with the message: 

## Features:
- **Simple Keypad Input**: Detects key presses from a 4x4 matrix of keys.
- **Serial Output**: Displays the key pressed in real-time on the Serial Monitor.

## Applications:
- **Password-based Systems**: Use the keypad to enter PINs or passcodes.
- **Control Systems**: Interface the keypad to control different functionalities, such as turning on/off devices.
- **Menu Selection**: Use the keypad for selecting options in a menu-driven interface.
