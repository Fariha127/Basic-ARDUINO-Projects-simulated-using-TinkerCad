# Project: DIY Calculator using a 4x4 Keypad and 16x2 LCD Display

This project involves building a simple calculator using an Arduino, a 4x4 keypad, and a 16x2 LCD display. The user can input numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) by pressing the corresponding keys on the keypad. The LCD screen displays the result of the calculations.

## Components Used:
- **Arduino Board** (Uno, Mega, etc.)
- **4x4 Keypad** (for number and operation input)
- **16x2 LCD Display** (for displaying numbers and results)
- **Resistors & Jumper Wires**

## Circuit Connections:
- **Keypad**: Connected to Arduino pins 0 to 7 for rows and columns.
- **LCD Display**: Connected to Arduino pins 8 to 13 for data and control.

## Code Explanation:
- The program reads input from the keypad and processes the numbers and operations.
- The calculator performs the selected arithmetic operation and shows the result on the LCD screen.
- It handles operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The "C" key resets the calculator.

## Features:
- **Arithmetic operations**: Supports basic math functions.
- **LCD display**: Shows input and results in real-time.
- **Keypad input**: Simple and intuitive interface for user interaction.
- **Clear functionality**: "C" key to reset the calculator.

## Applications:
- **Educational tool**: A great project for learning how to interface keypads, LCDs, and perform simple operations with Arduino.
- **Embedded Systems**: Can be part of larger projects requiring user input for calculations.
