# Interfacing a Photodiode with Arduino

## Project Overview:
This project demonstrates how to interface a **photodiode** with an Arduino to measure ambient light intensity. The photodiode acts as a light sensor, generating an analog voltage based on the amount of incident light. The Arduino reads this voltage and displays the corresponding sensor values on the **Serial Monitor**.

## Components Used:
- **Arduino Board** (Uno, Mega, etc.)
- **Photodiode** (L14F1, BPW34, or similar)
- **Resistor** (10kΩ - 100kΩ, depending on circuit type)
- **Connecting Wires**
- **Breadboard** (Optional)

## Circuit Connection:
- Connect the **anode (+)** of the photodiode to **5V** (if using a reverse-biased setup).
- Connect the **cathode (-)** to **A0** (analog input pin).
- Connect a **pull-down resistor** (e.g., 10kΩ) between **A0** and **GND**.
- If using a forward-biased configuration, reverse the photodiode polarity.

## Code Explanation:
### Initialization (setup()):
- Starts serial communication at **9600 baud** to display sensor readings.
- Configures **A0** as an input for the photodiode.

### Reading and Displaying Sensor Data (loop()):
- Continuously reads the **analog voltage** from the photodiode.
- Prints the value to the **Serial Monitor**.
- The higher the light intensity, the higher the sensor reading.

## Key Features:
- **Light Intensity Measurement**: Measures ambient light intensity using a photodiode and displays real-time values on the Serial Monitor.
- **Analog Sensor Reading**: Uses the analog input on the Arduino to read the voltage generated by the photodiode.

## Applications:
- **Ambient Light Monitoring**: Useful for measuring the intensity of ambient light in an environment.
- **Automatic Light Control**: Can be integrated into systems that adjust lighting based on ambient light conditions (e.g., automatic room lights).
- **Solar Power Systems**: Can be used in solar energy systems to measure light levels for optimization.
