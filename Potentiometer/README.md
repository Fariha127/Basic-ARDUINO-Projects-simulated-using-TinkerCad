### **Potentiometer**

This project demonstrates how a potentiometer can be used to control voltage. By adjusting the potentiometer, the resistance changes, and this alters the input voltage. 
### Key Features:
- **Voltage Control:** Adjusts the voltage based on potentiometer input.
- **Real-Time Adjustment:** User-controlled voltage and LED brightness.
- **Simple Circuit:** Ideal for learning about analog input, voltage control, and PWM.

### Applications:
- **Light Intensity Control:** Used in smart lighting systems for adjusting light brightness.
- **Voltage Regulation:** Can be applied in projects that require variable voltage control.
- **Educational Projects:** Perfect for learning about analog sensors and microcontroller interaction. 

This project serves as a basic introduction to analog voltage control, teaching fundamental concepts like voltage regulation, PWM, and the interaction between physical components and microcontrollers.
