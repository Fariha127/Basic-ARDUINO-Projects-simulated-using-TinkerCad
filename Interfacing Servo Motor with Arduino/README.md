### **Project: Interfacing Servo Motor with Arduino**

This project demonstrates how to interface a **Servo Motor** with an **Arduino** to control its position. The servo motor rotates between **0° and 180°**, then returns to **0°**, continuously repeating this movement in a back-and-forth motion. This can be useful for applications like robotics, automation, or any project requiring precise angular movement.

### **Components Used:**
1. **Arduino Board** (e.g., Uno, Nano)
2. **Servo Motor** (Standard or Micro)
3. **External Power Source** (if needed for high-power servos)
4. **Jumper Wires**
5. **Breadboard** (optional)

### **Circuit Connections:**
1. **Servo Motor:**
   - Connect the **Control Pin** (often the yellow or white wire) of the servo motor to **digital pin 7** on the Arduino (or another digital pin if changed in the code).
   - Connect the **Power Pin** (usually the red wire) to **5V** on the Arduino (or external power supply if required).
   - Connect the **Ground Pin** (usually the black or brown wire) to **GND** on the Arduino.

### **Code Explanation:**

1. **Servo Library:**
   - The **Servo** library is included at the start of the code (`#include <Servo.h>`), which simplifies controlling the servo motor by abstracting low-level control commands.

2. **Servo Object:**
   - A **Servo object** named `Myservo` is created to represent the servo motor, which will allow controlling its position.

3. **Servo Motor Control:**
   - The **`attach()`** function is used in the **`setup()`** function to specify which digital pin the servo is connected to (**pin 7** in this case).
   
4. **Servo Movement:**
   - The servo motor's position is set using the **`write()`** function.
   - The servo rotates from **0° to 180°** in steps, and after reaching **180°**, it rotates back to **0°**.
   - A **delay of 40 milliseconds** is added between each position change to allow the servo to reach the desired position smoothly.
   - After completing one full rotation (back and forth), there is a **1-second delay** after the first movement cycle and a **3-second delay** after the second cycle before the process repeats.

5. **Movement Pattern:**
   - The servo moves incrementally in a loop:
     - From **0° to 180°**: Gradually moves the servo to the maximum position.
     - Then it reverses from **180° to 0°**: Moves back to the initial position.

### **Applications:**
1. **Robotics**: This basic servo control can be used to create movements for robotic arms or mobile robots.
2. **Camera Pan/Tilt**: Control the pan/tilt mechanism for cameras or sensors.
3. **Automation**: Can be used to control valves, levers, or switches in automated systems.
4. **Toys and Models**: Control the movement of parts in toys, models, or interactive displays.

### **Possible Enhancements:**
1. **Servo Speed Control**: Introduce a potentiometer to control the speed of the servo's movement.
2. **Angle Input**: Use a keypad or serial input to control the servo's position, allowing more flexible usage.
3. **Multiple Servo Motors**: Control multiple servo motors simultaneously for more complex movements, such as robotic arms with more degrees of freedom.
4. **Servo Feedback**: Integrate sensors to provide feedback and adjust the servo position accordingly.

### **Conclusion:**
This project provides a simple but effective example of how to control a **Servo Motor** with **Arduino**. The motor moves between two positions, demonstrating the ability to accurately control rotational movements.
